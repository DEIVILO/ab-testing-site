## üîß A/B Testing Integration

### Replacing the Placeholder Snippet

The application includes a placeholder for your A/B testing snippet in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Replace the placeholder with your actual snippet:

```javascript
// Replace this placeholder in layout.tsx
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      // Your actual A/B testing snippet goes here
      (function() {
        // Your snippet code
      })();
    `
  }}
/>
```

### Testing Your Snippet

1. **Local Testing**: Run `npm run dev` and visit different pages to see how your snippet affects the UI
2. **Analytics Monitoring**: Visit `/analytics` to see real-time test data and user behavior
3. **Variant Assignment**: Users are automatically assigned to variants based on a hash of their user ID
4. **Event Tracking**: All user interactions are tracked and stored in localStorage for analysis

### Customizing Tests

Modify the test configurations in `src/lib/ab-testing.ts`:

```typescript
export const AB_TESTS: ABTestConfig[] = [
  {
    id: 'your-test-id',
    name: 'Your Test Name',
    trafficAllocation: 1.0, // 100% of traffic
    isActive: true,
    variants: [
      {
        id: 'control',
        name: 'Control',
        weight: 0.5,
        modifications: [
          {
            selector: '#your-element',
            property: 'backgroundColor',
            value: '#000000',
            type: 'style'
          }
        ]
      }
      // Add more variants...
    ]
  }
]
```

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Built-in Analytics
